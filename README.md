## ⚠️ Browser Warning Notice  

You may encounter a **"Dangerous Site"** warning from Chrome while accessing the live Netlify app.  

**Why does this happen?**  
- Netlify-hosted apps with login pages or lower traffic are sometimes misflagged by Google Safe Browsing.  
- This does **not mean the site is malicious**. Our code is fully open-source and safe to explore or host yourself.  
- If you feel insecure or can’t trust it — try visiting in **Incognito Mode** (Chrome) or another browser.  

✅ **You can view all code here or deploy it safely on your own Netlify/GitHub Pages.**
