## ⚠️ Browser Warning Notice

You may encounter a **"Dangerous Site"** warning from Chrome while accessing the live Netlify app.

**Why does this happen?**
- Netlify-hosted apps with login pages or lower traffic are sometimes misflagged by Google Safe Browsing.
- This does **not mean the site is malicious**. Our code is fully open-source and safe to explore or host yourself.
- If you are feeling insecure or can't trust so try to visit it in incognito tab (chrome) or any other web browser.

✅ **You can view all code here or deploy it on your own Netlify/GitHub Pages safely.**
